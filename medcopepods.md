Copepods microbiome project

***Monthly sampling of the BBMO***

1) Vertical net (100um to 2000um)

- formol
- ethanol

note (use a 2000 mesh to filter the cotents of the fished sample)

2) Horitontal net (100um to 200um)

5 minutes tolled sample

3) Vertical net (20um to 100um).

- 20L/30L of prefiltered (100um) seawater. Once in the lab inverted filtration using a 20um mesh.
- Split the sample for DNA / Lugol / Formol (note: we need only 1 for DNA ond one for morphology lugol or formol)

*** Experimetns with copepod

Starvation experiemnt

3 samples of starved lab copepods vs 3 samples of starved wild copepods
3 samples of fed lab copepods vs 3 samples of starved wild copepods

3 water filteres by 3um anc collecting at 0.2
3 water unfiltered by 3um and collecting at 0.2
3 water filtere by 3um and collecting at 0.2 + copepod
3 water unfiltered by 3 and collecting at 0.2 + copepod

Determine the number of copepods / zooplankton per mL and statistical variations of this number

Distances swimmend by a copepod in certain time compared with bacteria or other microeukaryotes.

In a stoecker style determine if a copepod regularly inoculates the enviroment with bacteria

Which volum of water "moves" with the copepod?
